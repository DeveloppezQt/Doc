          Copyright (C) 2000 by Catharon Productions, Inc.

Introduction
============

  This  license  applies to  source  files  distributed by  Catharon
  Productions,  Inc.  in  several  archive packages.   This  license
  applies  to all files  found in  such packages  which do  not fall
  under their own explicit license.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We  don't promise that  this software works.  However,  we are
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      Catharon Code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We disclaim  all warranties  covering the packages  distributed by
  Catharon  Productions, Inc.  and  assume no  liability related  to
  their use.

Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `Catharon Package', `package',
  and  `Catharon  Code'  refer   to  the  set  of  files  originally
  distributed by Catharon Productions, Inc.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program  is referred  to  as `a  program  using  one of  the
  Catharon Packages'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  Catharon  Package(s),  including  all  source code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The  Catharon   Packages  are  copyright  (C)   2000  by  Catharon
  Productions, Inc.  All rights reserved except as specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

  THE CATHARON PACKAGES ARE PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO
  USE THE CATHARON PACKAGE.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  Catharon Packages (in both source  and object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
      (`license.txt') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
      to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
      accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
      unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
      source files.

    o Redistribution  in binary form must provide  a disclaimer that
      states  that the  software is  based in  part on  the  work of
      Catharon Productions, Inc. in the distribution documentation.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the Catharon Packages, not just  the unmodified files.  If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither Catharon Productions, Inc.  and contributors nor you shall
  use  the  name  of  the  other  for  commercial,  advertising,  or
  promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest, but do not  require, that you use the following phrase
  to refer to this software in your documentation: 'this software is
  based in part on the Catharon Typography Project'.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.  However,  as  the Catharon  Packages are  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  Catharon
  Packages,  you indicate  that you  understand and  accept  all the
  terms of this license.

submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
modifications and may provide additional or different license
terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of
Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.


5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only
if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
warranty or additional liability.

<db:title>IAccessible2 IDL Specification</db:title>
<db:para><db:emphasis>IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements Microsoft's earlier work on MSAA. This API fills critical accessibility API gaps in the MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was created out of necessity to produce a usable and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based office suite for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an engineered accessibility interface allowing application developers to leverage their investment in MSAA while also providing an Assistive Technology (AT) access to rich document applications such as the IBM Workplace productivity editors and web browsers such as Firefox. The additional functionality includes support for rich text, tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large mainstream applications.</db:emphasis> – quoted from <db:link xlink:href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2</db:link>.</db:para>

<db:para>The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code. These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both* licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your needs.</db:para>
<db:para>To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear: CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) *or* the Apache License, Version 2.0</db:para>
<db:para>However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the GPL.</db:para>
<db:para>You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or added features.</db:para>
<db:para>Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for more information.</db:para>
