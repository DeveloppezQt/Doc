<db:para>Qt Designer forms are processed at run-time to produce dynamically-generated user interfaces. In order to generate a form at run-time, a resource file containing a UI file is needed. Applications that use the form handling classes need to be configured to be built against the Qt UI Tools module. This is done by including the following declaration in a <db:code>qmake</db:code> project file to ensure that the application is compiled and linked appropriately.</db:para>
<db:programlisting language="cpp">QT += uitools
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>A form loader object, provided by the <db:link xlink:href="quiloader.xml">QUiLoader</db:link> class, is used to construct the user interface. This user interface can be retrieved from any QIODevice. For example, a QFile object can be used to obtain a form stored in a project's resources. The QUiLoader::load() function takes the user interface description contained in the file and constructs the form widget.</db:para>
<db:para>To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:</db:para>
<db:programlisting language="cpp">#include &amp;lt;QtUiTools&amp;gt;
